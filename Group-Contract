Ground Rules:
Be respectful
Communicate regularly
Split work evenly 
Be prepared

Three things
Don’t go MIA
Don’t miss deadlines
Don’t procrastinate

I function best in groups when group members communicate
I function best in groups when group members meet deadlines

I really hope our group can succeed
I really hope our group can communicate well

We want to emphasize communication so that we can meet deadlines and figure out how to get assignments done.
